# Gene Splicing Data Visualization Using R

## Overview
This project focuses on the visualization of gene splicing mechanisms by analyzing exon and intron structures using R. The aim was to create meaningful plots that illustrate splicing variations in biological data, aiding molecular biology research and interpretation.

## Tools Used
- R
- ggplot2
- Custom functions for data parsing
- Bioinformatics CSV dataset

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data parsing and cleaning in R
- Genomic data interpretation
- ggplot2 visualization
- Gene structure analysis

## Project Steps
1. Imported gene splicing datasets in CSV format.
2. Parsed exon-intron positions from raw data.
3. Used ggplot2 and base R plots to represent gene structures.
4. Created clear exon-intron diagrams to highlight splicing patterns.
5. Compared alternative splicing events across genes visually.

## Outcome
Created well-labeled, informative gene splicing plots, supporting further genomic analysis and academic visualization needs. Demonstrated proficiency in visualizing molecular biology datasets using R.
